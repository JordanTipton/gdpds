The GDP Discovery Service (GDPDS) provides secure discovery and advertisement to clients using the Global Data Plane (GDP). GDPS servers advertise themselves on local networks, allowing clients to connect to them and advertise their capabilities to other clients connected to the GDP. This allows querying clients to identify clients which they have permission to interact with and which possess specific capabilities. GDPDS is designed to be used by lightweight and mobile clients while still providing the option of client authentication.

A further description of the GDPDS can be found within the pdf and html pages within this repo.
